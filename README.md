# üé¨ JoshMovies Scraper & Downloader

A powerful and user-friendly command-line tool designed to simplify the process of getting content from `joshmovies.com`. This script intelligently handles the complex redirect chains and ad-link pages, allowing you to get the final, direct download link with just a few prompts.

It can handle both movies and TV series, automatically detecting the content type and adjusting its strategy accordingly.

## ‚ú® Features

*   **Smart Content Detection:** Automatically identifies whether a link is for a single movie or a full series and adapts its scraping workflow.
*   **User-Friendly Interface:** A clean, color-coded command-line interface guides you through every step of the process.
*   **Choice of Output:** You can choose to either directly download the video files or save the final links neatly into a Markdown (`.md`) file.
*   **Bulk Processing for Series:** When a series is detected, the tool fetches the complete episode list and allows you to download a specific range of episodes (e.g., episodes 5 through 10).
*   **Append, Don't Overwrite:** When saving links, the script adds new links to your file without overwriting the existing contents.
*   **Persistent Output Directory:** The tool remembers the output folder you used during a session, so you don't have to re-type it every time.

## Act like a reasonable human, not a robot.**

*   **To Avoid Getting Blocked:**
    *   You can use the tool to download a movie or a full season without issue.
    *   After downloading a full season, **wait a few minutes** before starting another one.
    *   **Do not** run the script in a rapid, back-to-back loop for hours. This high-frequency activity is what gets your IP address blocked by websites.
